# Python-To-Java-Translator
In this project we aim to apply compiler design concepts using 
python programming language to develop a tool capable of 
converting Python code containing if statements and while 
statements into equivalent Java code. Additionally, the tool will 
generate a parse tree that visualizes the structure of the translated 
code.
